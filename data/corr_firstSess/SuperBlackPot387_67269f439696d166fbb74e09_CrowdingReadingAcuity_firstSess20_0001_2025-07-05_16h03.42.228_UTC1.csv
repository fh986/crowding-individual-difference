We strongly encourage you to complete both sessions of the experiment!",60,5,0,USD,15,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,67506ef48ae0fbccdc9b0326,TRUE,desktop,"audio,camera",,,automatic,0,," 0,100",,,All countries available,,,Standard sample,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,,,,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,60,FALSE,15,1000000,1000000,FALSE,15,rsvp,,,,,,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE," -50, -40,-30,-25,-20,-15,-10,-3.1",1.5,4,0.5,2.5,2.5,FALSE,-13.1,10000,200,FALSE,1.5,blindspot,TRUE,FALSE,"[25,35,50,70,100,140,160,180]",1,10,FALSE,,TRUE,0,rsvp_foveal_block1,24,,2,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,centerFixation,"0.5,0.5",FALSE,abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz,Roboto Mono,google,1,,FALSE,arial.woff2,1,abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz,"0,0,0,1",ltr,,normal,,abc,TRUE,2000,1000,0.8,0.8,FALSE,FALSE,0.2,,none,10000000000,300,file,regular,0,0,,,Verdana,"0,0,0,1",TRUE,0.5,15,browser,,,,topLeft,,upperLeft,English,,,FALSE,FALSE,"0,0,0,0,0,0,1","0,0,0,1",0,FALSE,"0,0","0,1,0.3,FALSE,0.05,2,0,0,1,1","0,0,1,1",0,2,0,1.5,0.2,0.05,FALSE,"0.5,0.05,0,0,0,0,1",FALSE,0.5,1,FALSE,"0,0,0,1",TRUE,freeze,FALSE,0.1,circle,0,0.3,2,1.4,0.05,0,0,TRUE,1,0.03,TRUE,FALSE,2,-100,,,FALSE,5,1,FALSE,,60,-1,FALSE,,FALSE,60,0,,FALSE,0.1,70,70,0,0,,,1,,FALSE,,,column,FALSE,FALSE,1004words_mid400.txt,FALSE,TRUE,,57,character,nominalSize,1.2,1,4,1,12,5,3,4,0.5,spacingDeg,spacingDeg,0.9,12,0.00043,0.5,6,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,1.25,0.75,FALSE,,TRUE,TRUE,scientist,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,86400,TRUE,1,,FALSE,3,5,3,TRUE,FALSE,60,"0.92,0.92,0.92,1",FALSE,0,FALSE,FALSE,pxPerDeg,"0.5,0.03,1000",TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,bottom,bottom,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,bottomRight,bottomRight,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,disabled,,0,top,FALSE,TRUE,,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,2.3,0.01,ideal,2,125,38.5,2,radial,FALSE,1.4,typographic,screen,2,0.05,center,"0,0,0,1",-1,0,0,0.15,0,0,0.167,0,,FALSE,rsvpReading,1,8,5,,10,_,0.1,0,0,0,$,3,2,FALSE,9,20,,FALSE,20000,-999,0.3,-0.3,,10000000000,identify,0.083,10000000000,0,FALSE,1.5,10000000000,10000000000,10000000000,0.1,1.4,2.3,0.01,,2,2,targetDurationSec,8,TRUE,QUEST,0.7,FALSE,FALSE,1.2,40,,,,,,,,,2022.1.3-threshold-prod,8,desktop,Windows 10,Windows,Chrome,137.0.0.0,en-GB,"[1536,776]",SuperBlackPot387,0001,SuperBlackPot387,SuperBlackPot387,67269f439696d166fbb74e09,6865b4e858858fd5027adc36,68658e40fac61fe96102da4f,,0.078,3753.405,,,,,,,,,,,15_1,"0,0","768,432",FALSE,"[(-9.9694, -5.6078), (9.9694, 5.6078)]",-1.224817099,-1.224817099,7.600937144,,,-1.224817099,,,,,,,,,,1.287,1.2883,9.99999E-05,"July 5, 2025 at 4:05:56 PM, UTC",1751731556.313,"[(-0.0392, -0.1373), (0.4902, 0.4608)]",0.5469,0.4877,0.9531,38.71383637,96.4,95.87346414,45.18,1536,864,0.0035,0.0036,,,,,,,,,15_1,-1.220479838,0.033424678,-1.224817099,,,,,,,"0.062,0.063,0.069",,,,,0,TRUE,FALSE,72,,0,"[""monk"",""prize"",""posse""]",FALSE,,,,,,,400,400,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.059591306,0.059591306,3,"[object Object],[object Object],[object Object]","[object Object],[object Object],[object Object]","<div class=""phrase-identification-clickable-categories"" id=""phrase-identification-clickable-category""><div class=""phrase-identification-category-column"" id=""phrase-identification-category-column-monk0""><div class=""phrase-identification-category-title resize-fontSize-to-fit"" id=""phrase-identification-category-title-monk0"">_____</div><div id=""phrase-identification-category-item-monk"" class=""phrase-identification-category-item resize-fontSize-to-fit"" style=""font-family: arial;
