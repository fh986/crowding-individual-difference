We strongly encourage you to complete both sessions of the experiment!",60,5,0,USD,15,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,67506ef48ae0fbccdc9b0326,TRUE,desktop,"audio,camera",,,automatic,0,," 0,100",,,All countries available,,,Standard sample,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,,,,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,60,FALSE,15,1000000,1000000,FALSE,2,acuity,,,,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE," -50, -40,-30,-25,-20,-15,-10,-3.1",1.5,4,0.5,2.5,2.5,FALSE,-13.1,10000,200,FALSE,1.5,,TRUE,FALSE,"[25,35,50,70,100,140,160,180]",1,FALSE,,TRUE,0,acuity_R8_block1,35,,2,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,centerFixation,"0.5,0.5",FALSE,abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz,Roboto Mono,google,1,,FALSE,Sloan.woff2,1,DHKNORSVZ,"0,0,0,1",,normal,,abc,TRUE,2000,1000,0.8,0.8,FALSE,FALSE,0.2,,none,10000000000,300,file,regular,0,0,,,Verdana,"0,0,0,1",TRUE,0.5,17,browser,,,What letter did you see?,topLeft,Keep the cursor at the center of the black cross until the letter appears.,upperLeft,English,,,FALSE,FALSE,"0,0,0,0,0,0,1","0,0,0,1",0,FALSE,"0,0","3,1,1.1,FALSE,0.05,0.8,0,0,0.6,1","0,0,1,1",-0.25,2,0,1.5,0.2,0.05,FALSE,"0.5,0.05,0,0,0,0,1",FALSE,0.5,2,FALSE,"0,0,0,1",TRUE,freeze,TRUE,0.15,circle,0.5,0.4,1,1.4,0.05,0,0.3,TRUE,1,0.03,TRUE,FALSE,2,-100,,,FALSE,5,1,FALSE,,60,-1,FALSE,,FALSE,60,0,,FALSE,0.1,70,70,0,0,,,1,,FALSE,,,column,FALSE,FALSE,,FALSE,FALSE,,57,character,nominalSize,1.2,1,4,1,12,5,3,4,0.5,spacingDeg,spacingDeg,0.5,12,0.00043,0.5,6,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,1.25,0.75,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,scientist,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,30,TRUE,1,,FALSE,3,6,6,TRUE,FALSE,60,"0.92,0.92,0.92,1",FALSE,0,FALSE,FALSE,pxPerDeg,"0.5,0.03,1000",TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,bottom,bottom,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,bottomRight,bottomRight,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,disabled,,0,top,FALSE,TRUE,,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,2.3,0.01,ideal,2,125,38.5,2,radial,FALSE,1.4,ratio,screen,2,0.05,center,"0,0,0,1",-1,0,0,0.15,8,0,0.167,0,,letter,1,8,5,,10,_,0.1,0,0,0,$,3,2,FALSE,9,20,,FALSE,20000,-999,0.3,-0.3,,10000000000,identify,0.083,10000000000,0,FALSE,1.5,10000000000,10000000000,10000000000,0.1,1.4,2.3,0.01,,4,2,targetSizeDeg,10,TRUE,QUEST,0.7,FALSE,FALSE,1.2,40,,,,,,,,,2022.1.3-threshold-prod,8,desktop,Windows 10,Windows,Chrome,136.0.0.0,en-GB,"[1536,776]",GreatBrownBat682,0001,GreatBrownBat682,GreatBrownBat682,6796a57996ad2f5398d6af0b,6840be1aaab9c4ad72f5a27f,6840a9176a0300ae13cbb006,,0.055,6854.1931,,,,,,,,,,,2_2,"0,0","768,432",FALSE,"[(-21.7305, -12.2234), (21.7305, 12.2234)]",-0.427355153,-0.427355153,4.889055056,0.0024,0.838364444,-0.427355153,0.19499492,25.02689481,12.26883,0,"H, S, K",,,"height : 12,  width : 14,  x: 270,  y: -15",,,FALSE,12.26883,7.449148138,3.3066,9.99999E-05,"June 5, 2025 at 12:11:36 AM, UTC",1749082296.022,"[(-0.3036, -0.3036), (0.3036, 0.3036)]",1.0156,1,1,3.3054,38.79289136,41.3,40.13201241,46.69,1536,864,0.0106,0.0108,711.8527498,814.8508921,4095.75,711.8527498,814.8508921,4095.75,814.8508921,814.8508921,2_2,-0.425230723,0.050295632,-0.427355153,,,,[],,0.0106,0.1512,0.0315,"durationAcceptable,latenessAcceptable,noBlackout","true,true,true",goodtest,1,TRUE,FALSE,35,s,1,"[""s""]",NaN,1.6977,1.7085,FALSE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,72,73,72,1,,-0.427355153,-0.427355153,2_2,1,,TRUE,,trialsVal,0.602059991,4.94066E-324,1.79769E+308,2,0.7,35,4.94066E-324,2.3,0.01,0.111111111,0.01,,,,,,,,,CrowdingReadingAcuity_firstSess.xlsx,NAN,TRUE,6826.0456
