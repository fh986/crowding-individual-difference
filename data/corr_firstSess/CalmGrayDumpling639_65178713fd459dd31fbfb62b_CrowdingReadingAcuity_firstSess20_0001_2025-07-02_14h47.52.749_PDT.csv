We strongly encourage you to complete both sessions of the experiment!",60,5,0,USD,15,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,67506ef48ae0fbccdc9b0326,TRUE,desktop,"audio,camera",,,automatic,0,," 0,100",,,All countries available,,,Standard sample,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,,,,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,60,FALSE,15,1000000,1000000,FALSE,14,rsvp,,,,,,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE," -50, -40,-30,-25,-20,-15,-10,-3.1",1.5,4,0.5,2.5,2.5,FALSE,-13.1,10000,200,FALSE,1.5,blindspot,TRUE,FALSE,"[25,35,50,70,100,140,160,180]",1,10,FALSE,,TRUE,0,rsvp_foveal_practice,5,,2,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,centerFixation,"0.5,0.5",FALSE,abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz,Roboto Mono,google,1,,FALSE,arial.woff2,1,abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz,"0,0,0,1",ltr,,normal,,abc,TRUE,2000,1000,0.8,0.8,FALSE,FALSE,0.2,,none,10000000000,300,file,regular,0,0,,,Verdana,"0,0,0,1",TRUE,0.5,15,browser,,,,topLeft,,upperLeft,English,,,FALSE,FALSE,"0,0,0,0,0,0,1","0,0,0,1",0,FALSE,"0,0","0,1,0.3,FALSE,0.05,2,0,0,1,1","0,0,1,1",0,2,0,1.5,0.2,0.05,FALSE,"0.5,0.05,0,0,0,0,1",FALSE,0.5,1,FALSE,"0,0,0,1",TRUE,freeze,FALSE,0.1,circle,0,0.3,2,1.4,0.05,0,0,TRUE,1,0.03,TRUE,FALSE,2,-100,,,FALSE,5,1,FALSE,,60,-1,FALSE,,FALSE,60,0,,FALSE,0.1,70,70,0,0,,,1,,FALSE,,,column,FALSE,FALSE,1004words_first200.txt,FALSE,TRUE,,57,character,nominalSize,1.2,1,4,1,12,5,3,4,0.5,spacingDeg,spacingDeg,0.9,12,0.00043,0.5,6,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,1.25,0.75,FALSE,,TRUE,TRUE,scientist,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,86400,TRUE,1,,FALSE,3,5,3,TRUE,FALSE,60,"0.92,0.92,0.92,1",FALSE,0,FALSE,FALSE,pxPerDeg,"0.5,0.03,1000",TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,bottom,bottom,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,bottomRight,bottomRight,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,disabled,,0,top,FALSE,TRUE,,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,2.3,0.01,ideal,2,125,38.5,2,radial,FALSE,1.4,typographic,screen,2,0.05,center,"0,0,0,1",-1,0,0,0.15,0,0,0.167,0,,FALSE,rsvpReading,1,8,5,,10,_,0.1,0,0,0,$,3,2,FALSE,9,20,,FALSE,20000,-999,0.3,-0.3,,10000000000,identify,0.083,10000000000,0,FALSE,1.5,10000000000,10000000000,10000000000,0.1,1.4,2.3,0.01,,2,2,targetDurationSec,8,TRUE,QUEST,0.7,FALSE,FALSE,1.2,40,,,,,,,,,2022.1.3-threshold-prod,24,desktop,Windows 10,Windows,Chrome,137.0.0.0,en-US,"[1707,932]",CalmGrayDumpling639,0001,CalmGrayDumpling639,CalmGrayDumpling639,65178713fd459dd31fbfb62b,686597d965d23fb345592927,68658e40fac61fe96102da4f,,0.064,3774.304,,,,,,,,,,,14_1,"0,0","853,533",FALSE,"[(-24.1942, -15.1231), (24.1942, 15.1231)]",-1.414863348,-1.414863348,3.265916332,,,-1.414863348,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.6026,0,"July 2, 2025 at 10:50:40 PM, UTC",1751496640.025,"[(-0.0356, -0.1246), (0.445, 0.4183)]",0.5469,0.4877,0.9531,1.6019,38.39436299,37.5,35.78235752,49.77,1707,1067,0.0025,0.0026,,,,,,,,,14_1,-1.46416738,0.220058742,-1.414863348,,,,,,,"0.054,0.039,0.043",,,,,1,TRUE,FALSE,15,,1,"[""theme"",""chalk"",""fight""]",,,,FALSE,,,,,,,200,200,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.038471281,0.038471281,3,"[object Object],[object Object],[object Object]","[object Object],[object Object],[object Object]","<div class=""phrase-identification-clickable-categories"" id=""phrase-identification-clickable-category""><div class=""phrase-identification-category-column"" id=""phrase-identification-category-column-theme0""><div class=""phrase-identification-category-title resize-fontSize-to-fit"" id=""phrase-identification-category-title-theme0"">_____</div><div id=""phrase-identification-category-item-claw"" class=""phrase-identification-category-item resize-fontSize-to-fit"" style=""font-family: arial;
