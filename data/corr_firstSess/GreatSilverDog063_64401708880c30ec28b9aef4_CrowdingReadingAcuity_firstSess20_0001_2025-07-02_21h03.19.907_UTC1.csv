In this block, you must keep your cursor at the center of a black cross until a letter appears. While your cursor is at the center of the cross, please keep your eyes on the cross as well. The letter will appear away from the cross, in the corner of your eye. It will flash quickly. After the letter disappear, you will report the letter you see. The size of the letter can vary greatly from trial to trial. In some trials, the letter might be very small. Please try your best to keep your eyes on the cross at the center and view the letter with your side vision.
