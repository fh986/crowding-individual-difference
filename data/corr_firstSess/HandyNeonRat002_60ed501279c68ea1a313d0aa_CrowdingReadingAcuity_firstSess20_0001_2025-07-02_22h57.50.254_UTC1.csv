We strongly encourage you to complete both sessions of the experiment!",60,5,0,USD,15,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,67506ef48ae0fbccdc9b0326,TRUE,desktop,"audio,camera",,,automatic,0,," 0,100",,,All countries available,,,Standard sample,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,,,,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,60,FALSE,15,1000000,1000000,FALSE,13,reading,,,,,,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE," -50, -40,-30,-25,-20,-15,-10,-3.1",1.5,4,0.5,2.5,2.5,FALSE,-13.1,10000,200,FALSE,1.5,blindspot,FALSE,FALSE,"[25,35,50,70,100,140,160,180]",1,10,FALSE,,TRUE,0,,35,,2,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,centerFixation,"0.5,0.5",FALSE,abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz,Roboto Mono,google,1,,FALSE,Roboto Mono,1,abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz,"0,0,0,1",ltr,,normal,,abc,TRUE,2000,1000,0.8,0.8,FALSE,FALSE,0.2,,none,10000000000,300,,regular,0,0,,,Verdana,"0,0,0,1",TRUE,0.5,17,browser,,,,topLeft,,upperLeft,English,,,FALSE,FALSE,"0,0,0,0,0,0,1","0,0,0,1",0,FALSE,"0,0","0,1,0.3,FALSE,0.05,2,0,0,1,1","0,0,1,1",0,2,0,1.5,0.2,0.05,FALSE,"0.5,0.05,0,0,0,0,1",FALSE,0.5,1,FALSE,"0,0,0,1",TRUE,freeze,FALSE,0.1,circle,0,0.3,2,1.4,0.05,0,0,TRUE,1,0.03,TRUE,FALSE,2,-100,,,FALSE,5,1,FALSE,,60,-1,FALSE,,FALSE,60,0,,FALSE,0.1,70,70,0,0,,,1,,FALSE,,,column,FALSE,FALSE,,FALSE,FALSE,,57,character,nominalSize,1.2,1,4,1,12,5,3,4,0.5,spacingDeg,spacingDeg,0.5,12,0.00043,0.5,6,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,1.25,0.75,FALSE,,TRUE,TRUE,scientist,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,86400,TRUE,1,,FALSE,3,6,6,TRUE,FALSE,60,"0.92,0.92,0.92,1",FALSE,0,FALSE,FALSE,pxPerDeg,"0.5,0.03,1000",TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,bottom,bottom,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,bottomRight,bottomRight,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,disabled,,0,top,FALSE,TRUE,,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,2.3,0.01,ideal,2,125,38.5,2,radial,FALSE,1.4,ratio,screen,2,0.05,center,"0,0,0,1",-1,0,0,0.15,0,0,0.167,0,,FALSE,letter,1,8,5,,10,_,0.1,0,0,0,$,3,2,FALSE,9,20,,FALSE,20000,-999,0.3,-0.3,,10000000000,,0.083,10000000000,0,FALSE,1.5,10000000000,10000000000,10000000000,0.1,1.4,2.3,0.01,,1,2,,1000000,TRUE,QUEST,0.7,FALSE,FALSE,1.1,50,,,,,,,,,2022.1.3-threshold-prod,8,desktop,Windows 10,Windows,Chrome,137.0.0.0,en-GB,"[1536,695]",HandyNeonRat002,0001,HandyNeonRat002,HandyNeonRat002,60ed501279c68ea1a313d0aa,6865ab5270932fe134f86ec6,68658e40fac61fe96102da4f,,,,,,,,,,,,,,13_1,"0,0","768,432",FALSE,"[(-21.5419, -12.1173), (21.5419, 12.1173)]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.001,"July 2, 2025 at 11:07:57 PM, UTC",1751497677.666,"[(-3.7383, -0.3464), (3.7531, 0.2338)]",0.4844,0.4579,0.9219,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Winter_5,How have some birds solved the problem of surviving winter?,By flying away in autumn to spend the winter months in more pleasant areas in the south,By flying away in autumn to spend the winter months in more pleasant areas in the south,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,By flying away in autumn to spend the winter months in more pleasant areas in the south,,,,,,,,,,4,0,5,0,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Winter_1|In the form of seeds which will then shoot up in spring and develop into new plants|How do many plants hibernate?|As underground tubers which will sprout in spring and develop into new plants|In the form of spores which will germinate in spring and develop into new plants|As dormant buds on branches which will open in spring and develop into new leaves|In the form of roots which will then sprout in spring and develop into new plants|In the form of seeds which will then shoot up in spring and develop into new plants,"Winter_2|They die and form new shoots again as it gets warmer in spring.
