We strongly encourage you to complete both sessions of the experiment!",60,5,0,USD,15,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,67506ef48ae0fbccdc9b0326,TRUE,desktop,"audio,camera",,,automatic,0,," 0,100",,,All countries available,,,Standard sample,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,,,,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,60,FALSE,15,1000000,1000000,FALSE,4,vernier,,,,,,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE," -50, -40,-30,-25,-20,-15,-10,-3.1",1.5,4,0.5,2.5,2.5,FALSE,-13.1,10000,200,FALSE,1.5,blindspot,TRUE,FALSE,"[25,35,50,70,100,140,160,180]",1,10,FALSE,,TRUE,0,vernier_L8_block1,35,,2,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,centerFixation,"0.5,0.5",FALSE,abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz,Roboto Mono,google,1,,FALSE,Roboto,1,LR,"0,0,0,1",ltr,,normal,,abc,TRUE,2000,1000,0.8,0.8,FALSE,FALSE,0.2,,none,10000000000,300,google,regular,0,0,,,Verdana,"1,1,1,1",TRUE,0.5,17,browser,,,,topLeft,Keep the cursor at the center of the white cross until the stimulus appears.,upperLeft,English,,,FALSE,FALSE,"0,0,0,0,0,0,1","0,0,0,1",0,FALSE,"0,0","3,1,1.1,FALSE,0.05,0.8,1,1,0.4,1","0,0,1,1",-0.25,2,0,1.5,0.2,0.05,FALSE,"0.5,0.05,0,0,0,0,1",FALSE,0.5,2,FALSE,"1,1,1,1",TRUE,freeze,TRUE,0.15,circle,0.5,0.4,1,1.4,0.05,0,0.3,TRUE,1,0.03,TRUE,FALSE,2,-100,,,FALSE,5,1,FALSE,,60,-1,FALSE,,FALSE,60,0,,FALSE,0.1,70,70,0,0,,,1,,FALSE,,,column,FALSE,FALSE,,FALSE,FALSE,,57,character,nominalSize,1.2,1,4,1,12,5,3,4,0.5,spacingDeg,spacingDeg,0.5,12,0.00043,0.5,6,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,1.25,0.75,FALSE,,TRUE,TRUE,scientist,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,30,TRUE,1,,FALSE,3,6,6,TRUE,FALSE,60,"0,0,0,1",FALSE,0,FALSE,FALSE,pxPerDeg,"0.5,0.03,1000",TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,bottom,bottom,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,bottomRight,bottomRight,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,disabled,,0,top,FALSE,TRUE,,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,2.3,0.01,ideal,2,125,38.5,2,radial,FALSE,1.4,none,screen,2,0.05,center,"1,1,1,1",-1,0,0,0.15,-8,0,0.167,0,,FALSE,vernier,1,8,5,,10,_,0.1,0,0,0,$,3,2,FALSE,9,20,,FALSE,20000,-999,0.3,-0.3,,10000000000,identify,0.083,10000000000,0,FALSE,1.5,10000000000,10000000000,10000000000,0.1,1.4,2.3,0.01,,1.5,2,targetOffsetDeg,5,TRUE,QUEST,0.7,FALSE,FALSE,1.2,40,,,,,,,,,2022.1.3-threshold-prod,16,desktop,Windows 10,Windows,Chrome,137.0.0.0,en-US,"[1920,919]",SpicyForestPear309,0001,SpicyForestPear309,SpicyForestPear309,66708c3d9418ec5491c5483e,6865912d1b79c521e1271a07,68658e40fac61fe96102da4f,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4_1,"0,0","1280,720",FALSE,"[(-31.0864, -17.4861), (31.0864, 17.4861)]",-1.42933941,-1.42933941,5.368444905,0.0015,0.865299467,-1.42933941,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3.1191,3.1197,0,"July 2, 2025 at 8:50:16 PM, UTC",1751489416.257,"[(-0.0513, 0), (0.4001, 0.4719)]",0.5625,0.5349,0.7188,36.12350715,43.5,39.96445632,43.17,2560,1440,0.0018,0.0019,,,,,,,,,4_1,-1.433797003,0.127640013,-1.42933941,,,,,,,,,,,goodtrial,1,TRUE,FALSE,,left,1,◀ Left,FALSE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,72,73,72,1,,-1.42933941,-1.42933941,4_1,1,,TRUE,,trialsVal,0.176091259,4.94066E-324,1.79769E+308,2,0.7,35,4.94066E-324,2.3,0.01,0.5,0.01,,,,,,,,,CrowdingReadingAcuity_firstSess.xlsx,NAN,TRUE,2633.0928
