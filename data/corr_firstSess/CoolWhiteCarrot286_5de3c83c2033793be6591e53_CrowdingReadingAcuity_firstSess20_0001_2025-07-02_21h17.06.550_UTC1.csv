The letters will appear away from the cross, in the corner of your eye. They will flash quickly. After the letters disappear, you will report the MIDDLE letter you see (In the example above, the correct answer is ""R""). The size of the letters and the spacing between the letters can vary greatly from trial to trial. In some trials, the letters might be very small. Please try your best to keep your eyes on the cross at the center and view the letters with your side vision.
