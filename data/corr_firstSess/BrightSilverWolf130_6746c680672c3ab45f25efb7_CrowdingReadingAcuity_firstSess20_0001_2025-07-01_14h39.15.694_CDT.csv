We strongly encourage you to complete both sessions of the experiment!",60,5,,USD,15,FALSE,FALSE,,,,,67506ef48ae0fbccdc9b0326,,desktop,"audio,camera",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,,,,TRUE,TRUE,,,,,,,,,,,13,reading,,,,,,,,,,,TRUE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,blindspot,FALSE,,,,,,,TRUE,,,35,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Roboto Mono,,abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.2,,,,,,,,,,,,"0,0,0,1",,,17,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0,1,0.3,FALSE,0.05,2,0,0,1,1",,0,,,,,,,,FALSE,,1,,"0,0,0,1",,freeze,FALSE,0.1,circle,0,0.3,2,1.4,0.05,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,FALSE,,57,character,nominalSize,1.2,,4,,,5,3,4,,spacingDeg,,0.5,,,,,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,1.25,0.75,,,,,,,,,86400,TRUE,,,,3,6,6,,,,"0.92,0.92,0.92,1",,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,FALSE,,,,,,,disabled,,,,,,,FALSE,FALSE,,FALSE,,,FALSE,,,,,,,,,,radial,,1.4,ratio,screen,,,,"0,0,0,1",,,,0.15,0,0,,,,,letter,,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.4,2.3,0.01,,1,2,,1000000,,,0.7,,,1.1,50,,,,,,,,,2022.1.3-threshold-prod,8,desktop,Windows 10,Windows,Chrome,137.0.0.0,en-US,"[1536,730]",BrightSilverWolf130,0001,BrightSilverWolf130,BrightSilverWolf130,6746c680672c3ab45f25efb7,6864392e1c5accaaf096996c,6864378605f56e891919d215,,,,,,,,,,,,,,13_1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TRUE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,14,15,14,1,15,4,0,5,0,1,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Winter_1|In the form of seeds which will then shoot up in spring and develop into new plants|How do many plants hibernate?|As underground tubers which will sprout in spring and develop into new plants|In the form of spores which will germinate in spring and develop into new plants|As dormant buds on branches which will open in spring and develop into new leaves|In the form of roots which will then sprout in spring and develop into new plants|In the form of seeds which will then shoot up in spring and develop into new plants,"Winter_2|They die and form new shoots again as it gets warmer in spring.
