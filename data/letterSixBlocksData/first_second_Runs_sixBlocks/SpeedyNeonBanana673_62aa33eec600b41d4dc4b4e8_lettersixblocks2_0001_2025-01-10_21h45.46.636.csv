For each trial of this experiment, you are first tracking a black moving crosshair with your cursor. The black crosshair is surrounded by three blue crosshairs that are also moving. Regardless, keep tracking the BLACK crosshair with your cursor: keep both the cursor and your gaze AT THE CENTER of the black crosshair. The crosshair is *bolded* when you are successfully tracking. After tracking the crosshair for about a second, a letter will flash on either the left or the right of the crosshair. At the end of the trial, report that letter. If you answer correctly, you will hear a “Beep”. When the letters flash, it will be tempting to move your gaze and look for them. However, PLEASE KEEP YOUR GAZE ON THE CROSSHAIR!
