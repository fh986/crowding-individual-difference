For each trial of this experiment, you are first tracking a black moving crosshair with your cursor. The black crosshair is surrounded by three blue crosshairs that are also moving. Regardless, keep tracking the BLACK crosshair with your cursor: keep both the cursor and your gaze AT THE CENTER of the black crosshair. The crosshair is *bolded* when you are successfully tracking. After tracking the crosshair for about a second, a row of three letters will flash on either the left or the right of the crosshair. At the end of the trial, report the MIDDLE letter. If you answer correctly, you will hear a “Beep”. When the letters flash, it will be tempting to move your gaze and look for them. However, PLEASE KEEP YOUR GAZE ON THE CROSSHAIR!
