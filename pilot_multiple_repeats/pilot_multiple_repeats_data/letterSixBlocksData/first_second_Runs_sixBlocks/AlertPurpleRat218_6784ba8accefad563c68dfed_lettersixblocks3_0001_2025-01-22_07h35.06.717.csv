Only the eye and gaze positions are retained.",40,10,0,USD,15,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,67506ef48ae0fbccdc9b0326,desktop,camera,,,automatic,0,," 0,100",,,All countries available,,,Standard sample,,,,English,,,,,,Yes,,,,,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,60,FALSE,600,FALSE,,,,,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE," -50, -40,-30,-25,-20,-15,-10,-3.1",4,0.5,2,2,FALSE,-13.1,10000,200,FALSE,3,TRUE,FALSE,"25, 35, 50, 70, 100, 140, 160, 180",1,FALSE,,TRUE,0,Six_L,35,,2,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,centerFixation,"0.5,0.5",FALSE,abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz,Roboto Mono,google,1,,FALSE,Sloan.woff2,1,DHKNORSVZ,"0,0,0,1",,normal,,abc,TRUE,1000,0.8,FALSE,FALSE,0.2,,none,10000000000,300,file,regular,0,0,,,Verdana,"0,0,0,1",TRUE,0.5,17,browser,,,,topLeft,Ready?
