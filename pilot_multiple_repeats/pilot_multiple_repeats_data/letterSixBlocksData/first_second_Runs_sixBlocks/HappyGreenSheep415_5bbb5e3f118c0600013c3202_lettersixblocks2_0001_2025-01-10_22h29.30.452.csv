You will be asked to rate and answer questions about different passages and you will perform letter identification tasks. Some of the tasks may be hard, so just try your best. No photos or video are recorded. Each webcam frame is used only inside your computer, solely to estimate where your eyes are and where they are looking, and then erased, within 10 seconds. Only the eye and gaze positions are retained.",40,5,0,USD,15,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,624cbccd41ed95b16cb5ce6b,desktop,camera,,,automatic,0,," 0,100",,,All countries available,,,Standard sample,,,,English,,,,,,Yes,,,,,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,60,FALSE,600,FALSE,,,,,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE," -50, -40,-30,-25,-20,-15,-10,-3.1",4,0.5,2,2,FALSE,-13.1,10000,200,FALSE,3,TRUE,FALSE,"25, 35, 50, 70, 100, 140, 160, 180",1,FALSE,,TRUE,0,Six_L,35,,2,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,centerFixation,"0.5,0.5",FALSE,abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz,Roboto Mono,google,1,,FALSE,Sloan.woff2,1,DHKNORSVZ,"0,0,0,1",,,normal,,abc,TRUE,1000,0.8,FALSE,FALSE,0.2,,none,10000000000,300,file,regular,0,0,,,Verdana,"0,0,0,1",TRUE,0.5,17,browser,,,,topLeft,Ready?
