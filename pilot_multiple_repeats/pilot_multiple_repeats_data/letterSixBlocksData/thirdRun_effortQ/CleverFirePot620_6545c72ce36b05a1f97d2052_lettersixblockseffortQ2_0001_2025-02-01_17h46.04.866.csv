Regardless, keep tracking the BLACK crosshair with your cursor: keep both the cursor and your gaze AT THE CENTER of the black crosshair. The crosshair is *bolded* when you are successfully tracking. After tracking the crosshair for about a second, a letter will flash on either the left or the right of the crosshair. At the end of the trial, report that letter. If you answer correctly, you will hear a “Beep”. When the letters flash, it will be tempting to move your gaze and look for them. However, PLEASE KEEP YOUR GAZE ON THE CROSSHAIR!

Only the eye and gaze positions are retained.",60,10,0,,15,,,,,,,67506ef48ae0fbccdc9b0326,desktop,camera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,Yes,,,,,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TRUE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TRUE,,,,,,TRUE,,Effort_6,1,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,Roboto Mono,,abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz,,,,,,,1000,,,,,,,,,google,,,,,,,"0,0,0,1",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0,1,0.3,FALSE,0.05,2,0,0,1,1",,0,,,,,,,,,,1,,"0,0,0,1",,,FALSE,0.1,circle,0,0.3,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,FALSE,,,57,,character,nominalSize,1.2,,4,,,,,5,3,4,,spacingDeg,,,0.5,,,,,,TRUE,,TRUE,FALSE,1.25,0.75,,,,,,,,86400,TRUE,,,,3,6,6,,,,"0.92,0.92,0.92,1",,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,,,,,,FALSE,,,,,,,,,,,,,ratio,screen,,,,"0,0,0,1",,,,0.15,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.5,,0.01,,1,,,1000000,,,0.7,,,1.1,40,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0,1,0,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TRUE,,,,,TRUE,1,,,,,,Effort6||How much effort did you put into the last block of trials?
