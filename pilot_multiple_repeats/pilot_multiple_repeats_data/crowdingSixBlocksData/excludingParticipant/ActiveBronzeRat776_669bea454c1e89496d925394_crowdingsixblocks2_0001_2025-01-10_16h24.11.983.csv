Regardless, keep tracking the BLACK crosshair with your cursor: keep both the cursor and your gaze AT THE CENTER of the black crosshair. The crosshair is *bolded* when you are successfully tracking. After tracking the crosshair for about a second, a row of three letters will flash on either the left or the right of the crosshair. At the end of the trial, report the MIDDLE letter.
