Regardless, keep tracking the WHITE crosshair with your cursor: keep both the cursor and your gaze AT THE CENTER of the white crosshair. The crosshair is *bolded* when you are successfully tracking. After tracking the crosshair for a while, a pair of vertical lines will flash on either the left or the right of the crosshair. The two lines are stacked, with an offset. Your job is to decide whether the TOP line is shifted to the Left or to the Right, relative to the lower line. Respond by clicking the “Left” or the “Right” buttons at the end of the trial. If you answer correctly, you will hear a “Beep”. When the lines flash, it will be tempting to move your gaze and look for them. However, PLEASE KEEP YOUR GAZE ON THE CROSSHAIR!
